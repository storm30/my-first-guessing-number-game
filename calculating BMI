"""Prompt the user "Enter your weight (in kgs)" and record weight
Prompt the user "What is your preferred unit of height? Type "F" for feet and "M" for meters" and record the preference
If user says "F" then prompt user "You will enter your height given as feet and inches. First enter feet" and record feet and then prompt user "Now enter inches" and record inches
If user says "M" then prompt user "What is your height in meters" and record height in meters
If user had chosen "F" then convert height into meters
Compute BMI using the following formula
Depending on the value of BMI, report the user's type given by the following table:
● BMI < 18.5 : UNDERWEIGHT ● 18.5 <= BMI < 25 : NORMAL ● 25 <= BMI < 30 : OVERWEIGHT ● BMI > 30 : VERY-OVERWEIGHT"""
